This is a clone of the SmartStatus Pebble App by Robert Hesse.

It adds button mods for controlling music playback:

- In calendar mode
  - short click up, refresh
  - short click down, refresh
  - long click select, change to music mode
- In music mode
  - short click up, volume up
  - long click up, next track
  - short click down, volume down
  - long click down, previous track
  - short click select, play/pause
  - long click select, change to calendar mode

To work this requires Robert's Smartwatch+ app from the iTunes store

The easiest way to build this is to import the github url into cloudpebble.net
